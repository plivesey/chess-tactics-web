            We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us ping you the Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates.

This may include accessing and sharing personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

In any such transfer of information, your personally-identifiable information would remain subject to this section.
