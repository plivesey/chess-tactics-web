            <p></p>
            <h2>11. Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services</h2>
            <p></p>

Lockwood Productions’ liability to you or any third party claiming through you for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to Lockwood Productions for the service in the 12 months prior to the initial action giving rise to liability. This is an aggregate limit. The existence of more than one claim hereunder will not increase this limit.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h2>19. Governing Law and Arbitration</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions, its subject matter and Lockwood Productions’ and your respective rights under these Terms and Conditions, as well as and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“Claim”) arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Oregon, United States of America, excluding the conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for Lockwood Productions’ right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lockwood Productions and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to chesstacticsapp@gmail.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Lockwood Productions’ Administration Office of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Lockwood Productions should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to chesstacticsapp@gmail.com; or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Lockwood Productions, LLC, Attention: 4445 NW Malheur Ave, Portland OR 97229. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought; and (z) set forth your name, address and contact information. If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator in Washington County in the State of Oregon, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms and Conditions. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or Lockwood Productions may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND LOCKWOOD PRODUCTIONS EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND LOCKWOOD PRODUCTIONS EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Lockwood Productions agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Washington County in the State of Oregon, and you and Lockwood Productions each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Lockwood Productions shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>20. Language</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>This agreement was originally written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>21. Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Lockwood Productions and you concerning the subject matter hereof. In the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. A waiver by Lockwood Productions or you of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. Lockwood Productions may assign its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without condition. These Terms and Conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of Lockwood Productions and you, and Lockwood Productions’ and your respective successors and permitted assigns.
